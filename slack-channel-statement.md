## F5 Slack Channel Information

F5 has created a [Slack channel](https://f5cloudsolutions.herokuapp.com) for community discussion and assistance on F5 solutions, including the Declarative Onboarding Extension (use the **declarative-onboard** channel).  This page is to clarify what to expect from the Slack channel and provide guidelines on usage.

There are F5 employees who are members of the Slack channel community who typically monitor the channel Monday to Friday, from 9am to 5pm PST, and will offer ***best-effort assistance***.  This slack channel community support should **not** be considered a substitute for F5 Technical Support. 
 
On the Slack channel, you should **NEVER**:
   - Enter any private or personally identifying information about you, your network, organization, and so on.
   - Enter any passwords/credentials, logs, or IP addresses.
   - Try to open a F5 technical support case through the Slack Channel.
   - Expect that F5 technical support monitors or uses this channel; they do not.
   - Expect that an F5 employee will always immediately respond on Slack. Employees will offer best-effort assistance, but there may be times when responses are delayed.

### Getting F5 technical support
