## Introduction
F5 Declarative onboarding uses a declarative model to initially configure a BIG-IP device with all of the required settings to get up and running.  This includes system settings such as licensing and provisioning, network settings such as VLANs and Self IPs, and clustering settings if you are using more than one BIG-IP system.

**IMPORTANT** Beginning with DO 1.8.0, the DO RPM, Postman collection, and checksum files will no longer be located in the **/dist** directory in this repository.  These files can be found on the [Release page](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-declarative-onboarding/releases), as **Assets**.

## Documentation
For the documentation on Declarative Onboarding, including download, installation, and usage instructions, see the Declarative Onboarding [User Guide](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-declarative-onboarding/latest).

### Example Declarative Onboarding declarations
The Declarative Onboarding documentation contains example declarations you can modify to suit your needs.  See the [Examples](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-declarative-onboarding/latest/examples.html) page.

## Filing Issues and Getting Help
If you come across a bug or other issue when using Declarative Onboarding, use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-declarative-onboarding/issues) to submit an issue for our team.  You can also see the current known issues on that page, which are tagged with a purple Known Issue label.

**Important**: Github Issues are consistently monitored by F5 staff, but should be considered as best effort only and you should not expect to receive the same level of response as provided by F5 Support. Please open a case as described below with F5 if this is a critical issue.

Because Declarative Onboarding v1.1.0 and later has been created and fully tested by F5 Networks, it is fully supported by F5. This means you can get assistance if necessary from [F5 Technical Support](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K25327565).

Be sure to see the [Support page](SUPPORT.md) in this repo for more details and supported versions of Declarative Onboarding.
