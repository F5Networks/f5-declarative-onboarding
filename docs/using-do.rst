Using Declarative Onboarding
============================

As mentioned in the prerequisites, to transmit Declarative Onboarding declarations you can use a
RESTful API client like Postman or a universal client such as cURL.  You can use the HTTP request methods POST and GET with Declarative Onboarding.

A client may supply a declaration with a POST request, and other request methods (currently only GET) work with the declaration previously
supplied via POST and retained by Declarative Onboarding.
