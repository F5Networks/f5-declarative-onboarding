Prerequisites and Requirements
------------------------------

The following are prerequisites for using F5 Declarative Onboarding:

- You must have an existing BIG-IP device with a management IP address.
- The BIG-IP must be running version 13.1.0 or later.
- Your BIG-IP user account must have the **Administrator** role.
- If you are using an F5 BYOL license, you must have a valid F5 Networks License Registration Key to include in your declaration.  If you do not have one, contact your F5 sales representative. If you do not use a valid F5 license key, your declaration will fail.  This is not a requirement if you are using a BIG-IP with pay-as-you-go licensing.
- You should be familiar with the F5 BIG-IP and F5 terminology.  For general information and documentation on the BIG-IP system, see the `F5 Knowledge Center <https://support.f5.com/csp/knowledge-center/software/BIG-IP?module=BIG-IP%20LTM&version=13.1.0>`_.
