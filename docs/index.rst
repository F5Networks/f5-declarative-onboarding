F5 Declarative Onboarding Documentation
=======================================

Welcome to the F5 Declarative Onboarding documentation. 

F5 Declarative onboarding uses a |declare| model to initially configure a BIG-IP device with all of the required settings to get up and running. A declarative model means you provide a JSON declaration rather than a set of imperative
commands. The declaration represents the configuration which Declarative Onboarding is responsible for creating on a BIG-IP system.  You send a declaration file using a single Rest API call. 

This guide contains information on downloading, installing, and using F5 Declarative Onboarding.
