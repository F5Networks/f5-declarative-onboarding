Introduction
------------

F5 Declarative onboarding uses a declarative model to bring up a BIG-IP device with all of the required initial settings. A declarative model means you provide a JSON declaration rather than a set of imperative
commands. The declaration represents the configuration which Declarative Onboarding is responsible for creating on a BIG-IP system. 

This guide contains information on downloading, installing, and using F5 Declarative Onboarding.
