Example Declarations
====================

This section contains a number of additional example declarations you can use. Use the following index, or the links on the right to go to a specific category of declaration.

The following categories were introduced with the release of DO 1.17.

.. IMPORTANT:: The following examples include passwords that may not be valid for BIG-IP v14.0 and later.  See |pass| for specific requirements.

.. NOTE:: All of the examples will work on BIG-IP and BIG-IQ, however, when using DO on a BIG-IQ, you must add the BIG-IQ section to the declaration (see :doc:`do-on-bigiq` and the :ref:`BIG-IQ examples<iqexamples>` for details).
