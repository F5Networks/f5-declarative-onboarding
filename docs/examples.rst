Example declarations
====================

The following examples show you some AS3 declarations and the BIG-IP LTM objects
they create.  

For more example declarations, see :ref:`additional-examples` (you can also see all AS3 properties in one declaration in :ref:`all-properties`).

If you missed it, we recommend you first read :doc:`composing-a-declaration` for a
breakdown of some of the components of a declaration.

**Note:** If you do not specify certain parameters in your declaration, the
system supplies default values. For example, if you do not specify a persistence
method (or specify *none*), the system uses Cookie persistence by default.
